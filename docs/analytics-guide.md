- **Click timestamp**
- **User session** (to track user journey)

### Traffic Sources
- **Direct traffic** (typed URL directly)
- **Social media** (Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
- **Search engines** (Google, Bing, etc.)
- **Referral sites** (other websites linking to you)

## üìà **Reading Your Analytics Data**

### Google Analytics Dashboard
Once set up, you'll see:
- **Real-time visitors** currently on your site
- **Daily/weekly/monthly** visitor trends
- **Top traffic sources** bringing you visitors
- **Device breakdown** (mobile vs desktop)
- **Geographic data** (which countries/cities)

### Key Metrics to Watch
1. **Unique Visitors** - how many different people visited
2. **Page Views** - total number of page loads
3. **Bounce Rate** - % of people who left immediately
4. **Click-through Rate** - % who clicked your buttons
5. **Traffic Sources** - where your visitors come from

## üîß **Advanced Setup Options**

### Custom Event Tracking
The page already tracks button clicks, but you can add more:
```javascript
// Track custom events
gtag('event', 'custom_action', {
  'event_category': 'engagement',
  'event_label': 'specific_action'
});
```

### Enhanced E-commerce (Future)
If you add booking/payment functionality later:
```javascript
// Track conversions
gtag('event', 'purchase', {
  'transaction_id': '12345',
  'value': 1.00,
  'currency': 'EUR'
});
```

## üìä **Quick Analytics Checklist**

- ‚úÖ **Google Analytics account created**
- ‚úÖ **Measurement ID added to HTML file**
- ‚úÖ **GDPR consent system active**
- ‚úÖ **Click tracking working**

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

### "No data showing in Google Analytics"
1. **Check your Measurement ID** - make sure it's correct
2. **Wait 24-48 hours** - data can take time to appear
3. **Test in incognito mode** - to avoid your own visits
4. **Check GDPR consent** - analytics only loads after consent

### "Tracking seems slow"
1. **Real-time reports** show data immediately
2. **Standard reports** update every 24 hours
3. **Use real-time tab** in Google Analytics for immediate feedback

## üéØ **Pro Tips**

1. **Exclude your own visits** - set up internal traffic filters
2. **Set up goals** - track when people click your buttons as conversions
3. **Weekly reports** - check your analytics every Monday
4. **Mobile-first** - most traffic will likely be mobile
5. **Privacy compliance** - your GDPR system handles this automatically
